        """Bulk registeration of view functions

        This helper method is useful when we need to register
        a series of view function and attach them to the url-endpoints
        having the same names as these functions have, i.e.
        view_func1   -> /view_func1
        view_func2   -> /view_func2 etc

        `bulk_register` just uses `.route` Blueprint method
        and applied it to all passed functions within the`views` array.

        If one need to override this default behavior of registration
        which assigns (view_func -> /view_func, with allowed GET and POST
        methods), one can provide mapping variable and change this default
        behavior on per-view basis:

        if `route_urls` dictionary includes record
        `"view_function_name": "one1"`, default registration behavior will be
        overriden: registered url-endpoint for
        `view_function_name` will be `/one1`.

        The same technique is used to override allowed methods;
        Note: all views registered by `bulk_register` method by default have
        have GET and POST methods as allowed.

        :param route_urls: customize view url , defaults to dict()
        :type route_urls: dict, optional
        :param route_methods: per-view customization of allowed http-methods,
                              defaults to dict()
        :type route_methods: dict, optional

        for view in views:
            if callable(view):
                methods = route_methods.get(view.__name__, default_methods)
                url = route_urls.get(view.__name__, f"{view.__name__}")
                url = '/' + url if not url.startswith('/') else url
